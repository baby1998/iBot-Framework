### Introduction

# Welcome to the Simulation Platform!

Simulation Platform is an empowring environment with collection of tools to enable people to ideate, simulate and build anything.
This Platform uses decentralized networks of connected computeblocks running on highly secured platforms.

Intention is to build next generation build and test platform 
that is visually rich and highly intutive to humans. 



The first blockchain in the Cosmos Network is the Cosmos Hub, whose native token is the Atom. Cosmos is a permission-less network, meaning that anybody can build a blockchain on it.

Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary. 416181be
