# iBot-Framework
An intelligence logistics framework

What is iBot Framework?
iBot Framework is a pocket universe consists of all bots. Like our universe, botverse has rules that all bots have to follow.

What is a bot?
Bot is a smart software agent contained in a box. This could be either a literal box or abstract box. 

How does a bot get smart?
When a new bot is spawned, it comes with a predefined structure and features.. 
Like a newborn, baby bot too come with a small but mostly empty brain.
It has ability to observe and store its interactions, over time these memories help bot develop intuitions of its function.
We call intuitions as bot awareness.. These awareness is optimized for bots purpose.

Are there types of bots?
Yes, there are just 2 types of bots. Databot and Metabot
but each bot can have different flavours. There's no limit in favors :)

What's difference between Databot and Metabot and flavours?
Just to make it a simple analogy,
Think of Databot as Atom and Metabot as Molecule.
Like all Atoms have a single nuclei, similarly all databots have single piece of information in them.. 
And different atoms arranged in some configuration make different molecule, similarly bots arranged in configuration make Metabots.

However Metabot are more complex than that of molecule. Remember literal and abstract box above? 

The scope of Metabots can go beyond any literal structure and into higher abstractions. 
Bunch of molecules make up Proteins. Protein, calcium and other together make up our limbs and our libs make up what we call a body.
That's what special about Metabots. They have no limit. they can be small as a single molecule or large as whole universe.. Metaphysically :)
