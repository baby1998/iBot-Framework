**What is iBot Framework?**

iBot Framework is a pocket universe consists of all bots. Like our universe, botverse has rules that all bots have to follow.

**What is a bot?**

Bot is a smart software agent contained in a box. This could be either a literal box or abstract box. 

**How does a bot get smart?**

When a new bot is spawned, it comes with a predefined structure and features.. 
Like a newborn, baby bot too come with a small but mostly empty brain.
It has ability to observe and store its interactions, over time these memories help bot develop intuitions of its function.
We call intuitions as bot awareness.. These awareness is optimized for bots purpose.

**Are there types in bots?**

Yes, there are just 2 types of bots. 
- Databot 
- Metabot

However each bot can have different flavours. There's no limit in flavours :)

**What's difference between Databot and Metabot?**

All bots are spawed as databot. 
If a bot contains a single piece of information then it databot. Databot handles the real data.
Metabots contain other databots and metabots. Metabots on their own do not work with real data, they have to have at least 1 databot in them. 

***For example:***

Firstname, Lastname, Phone, City are a databots. 
Person is a Merabot that contains above databots. 

***here’s a fun analogy,***

Think of Databot as Atom and Metabot as Molecule.
Like all Atoms have a single nuclei, similarly all databots work with single piece of information in them.. The real data that flows through from them and gets stored somewhere.. Different atoms arranged in configuration make different molecules, so bots arranged in configurations make Metabots. Simple.. 

***But Metabot is a bit complex than that. Remember literal and abstract box above? ***

The scope of Metabots can go beyond any literal structure and into infinitely higher abstractions. 
Bunch of molecules make up proteins. Protein, calcium and other things together make up limbs and limbs make up what we call a human body.

That's what makes Metabots so special. They have no limit. they can be small as a single molecule or large as whole universe, they can be literal, abstract or metaphysical depending on purpose :)


**What’s flavour in bots?**

Flavour is basically personality difference, more specifically different in awareness, functions or features. You can clone same bot and train in with different environment and different datasets. 
For example, a search bot specially trained for medical purpose has a distinct flavour compare to other bots. You can train your bots to have specific flavours. 

**What are the examples of bots?**

***Example for databot:***

Firstname, lastname, weight, dob, address, email, nationality anything that is considered to be associated with single piece of data.. at least in the context its purpose. All real data flow through databots.. 

***Example for Metabot:***

Person, Customer, Google, Bank, Moster, Analyst, Mars, Bike etc.. it could be anything man, depends on application.


**What kind of awareness bots have?**
All bots are born with 3 basic types of awareness.
- Temporal awareness
- Contextual awareness
- Relational awareness.
